# Reason for recipe

This recipe was born out of a desire to get Gilded Blackstone without having to traverse the Nether and laboriously locate and collect Gilded Blackstone.
There were a few thoughts about the recipe's contents, the most important of which was ensuring that Gilded Blackstone couldn't be used as an infinite gold generator, by crafting it and getting more gold out of it than what you put in.
Either the total number of Gold Nuggets that go into the recipe had to be greater than or equal to the average amount of Gold Nuggets obtainable from the resulting Gilded Blackstone, or the prospect of using Gilded Blackstone to farm gold would pale in comparison to other, more efficient methods. Alongside this, I wanted the recipe to fit the vibe of Minecraft, so I looked towards other recipes for inspiration. The resulting number of Gilded Blackstone obtained made sense to match either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 for this reason as well.

We came up with 3 designs:
1. A compass-like recipe, with blackstone in the top, right, left, and bottom slots, and a Gold Ingot in the center, resulting in 2 Gilded Blackstone
2. A TNT-like recipe, with blackstone in the top, right, left, and bottom slots, and Gold Nuggets in all remaining slots, resulting in 1 Gilded Blackstone
3. A TNT-like recipe, with blackstone in the top, right, left, and bottom slots, and Gold Ingots in all remaining slots, resulting in 8 Gilded Blackstone

Using the fact that Gilded Blackstone drops 2-5 Gold Nuggets when broken with a Fortune pickaxe (the level of Fortune affects the drop rate, rather than the drop amount), this gives us an average of 3.5 Gold Nuggets per Gilded Blackstone mined. Considering the resource investment in these recipes, I determined that recipe #3 would fit the most. An input of 5 Gold Ingots equates to 45 Gold Nuggets, and the average amount of Gold Nuggets obtained from 8 Gilded Blackstone is 28. This leaves a loss of 17 Gold Nuggets, or nearly 2 Gold Ingots, per 8 crafted Gilded Blackstone, or alternatively just over 15 Gold Ingots lost per crafted stack, compared to exploring and mining the Gilded Blackstone with a Fortune III pickaxe. Gilded Blackstone isn't a reliable source of obtaining gold, and this keeps it that way, while also acting as a sort of tax for those who wish to skip the Nether traversal that is usually required to obtain this item.
